# Consolebrot
**This application has plenty of issues, I wouldn't expect it to work.**

**Refer instead to [an improved version in zig](https://github.com/bencookman/consolebrot-zig) as a way of learning the language.**

**Only works as an independent window (i.e. don't run it in a terminal, just double click the file to open an independent runtime). Only tested on Windows 10 - won't work on Linux or OSX systems. This is very much an alpha version.**

* Move around with Up/Down/Left/Right
* Zoom in with PgUp, out with PgDown

Originally compiled using Visual Studio, so to build the project use that. Also untested on platforms other than Windows 10.
